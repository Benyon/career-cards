                <strong>The Importance of Values & Needs – What is important to you in your Career and Life + WHY?</strong>
                <br> We all have a set of values; they are the things we believe in and hold dear.  They often change over time as a result of situations that affect and shape your life but we rarely audit or even consider them.
                <br> We also have needs.  These are things that we must have in order to feel motivated and they contribute to our sense of wellbeing.  Why do you want to work? What makes you get out of bed each day?
                <br> Without understanding your values and needs it is almost impossible to find real meaning and fulfilment, which is fundamental when it comes to finding the right job or type of work for you.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Instructions</strong> <br> Against statements 1-55 study these values and needs very carefully and decide which category each value or need fits into i.e.  ‘Essential’ (E), ‘Desirable’ (D) and ‘Not Important’ (N) and put the corresponding letter against each question in the answer box
